     *  Memento  (Memento)
     *      - stores internal state of the Originator object. The memento 
     *      may store as much or as little of the originator's internal 
     *      state as necessary at its originator's discretion.
     *      - protect against access by objects of other than the originator. 
     *      Mementos have effectively two interfaces. Caretaker sees a narrow 
     *      interface to the Memento -- it can only pass the memento to the 
     *      other objects. Originator, in contrast, sees a wide interface, one 
     *      that lets it access all the data necessary to restore itself to its 
     *      previous state. Ideally, only the originator that produces the 
     *      memento would be permitted to access the memento's internal state.
     *      
     *
     *  Originator  (SalesProspect)
     *      - creates a memento containing a snapshot of its current internal state.
     *      - uses the memento to restore its internal state
     *
     * 
     *  Caretaker  (Caretaker)
     *      - is responsible for the memento's safekeeping
     *      - never operates on or examines the contents of a memento.
