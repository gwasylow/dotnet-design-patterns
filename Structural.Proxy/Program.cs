     *  Proxy (MathProxy):
     *      - maintains a reference that lets the proxy access the 
     *      real subject. Proxy may refer to a Subject if the 
     *      RealSubject and Subject interfaces are the same.
     *      - provides an interface identical to Subject's so that 
     *      a proxy can be substituted for for the real subject.
     *      - controls access to the real subject and may be 
     *      responsible for creating and deleting it.
     *      other responsibilites depend on the kind of proxy:
     *          - remote proxies are responsible for encoding a request and 
     *              its arguments and for sending the encoded request to the 
     *          - real subject in a different address space.
     *          - virtual proxies may cache additional information about 
     *              the real subject so that they can postpone accessing it. 
     *              For example, the ImageProxy from the Motivation caches 
     *              the real images's extent.
     *          - protection proxies check that the caller has the access 
     *              permissions required to perform a request.
     *    
     *  Subject (IMath):
     *      defines the common interface for RealSubject and Proxy so 
     *      that a Proxy can be used anywhere a RealSubject is expected.
     *
     *  RealSubject (Math):
     *      defines the real object that the proxy represents.
